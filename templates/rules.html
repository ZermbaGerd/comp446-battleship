        You have 5 ships. They are precious. Your opponent also has 5 ships, which are evil
        and must be destroyed. They, however, will seek to destroy <i>your</i> precious 5 ships!
        End them.
    </p>
    <h2 id="setupinstr">Setup</h2>
    <p>
        Before the game starts, you'll have to place your ships onto the board. Click a ship on the small board to the left
        to pick it up. Then, click the square you want to place its endpoint onto on the big board to the right.
        This will show you where you can place it, as pictured below. Click any of the purple highlighted tiles
        to finish placing it.</p>
        <img src="static/assets/instructions/placing_ship.png" alt="A ship in the process of being placed." width="100" height="100">
        <p>You can press Escape to stop placing the ship. You can also select a ship you've already placed to move it
        somewhere else.
        Once the game starts, players will take turns. Once it's your turn, click a tile on the rightmost
        board to attack it! That will be your turn. You can see what your opponent has attacked via the
        board on the left.
    </p>
    <h2 id="gameplayinstr">Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        On your turn, click somewhere on the rightmost board, which shows where you've already attacked.
        If you don't hit anything, that tile will become a <img src="static/assets/miss.svg" alt="missed icon" class="embed">.
        If you hit a ship, you'll see a <img src="static/assets/hit.svg" alt="hit ship icon" class="embed">.
        And if you get the final blow on a ship, all of its tiles will turn into <img src="static/assets/destroyed.svg" alt="destroyed ship icon" class="embed">!
